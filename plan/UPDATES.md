# Plan Updates Summary

## Changes Made for API-Based LLM Approach

All plans have been updated to reflect that we're using external APIs (OpenAI/Anthropic) for LLM responses, with no local model downloads.

### Files Updated:

1. **01-project-overview.md**
   - Changed "LangChain.ts (AI integration, browser-only)" to "LangChain.js (AI integration via APIs)"

2. **03-langchain-integration.md** ✅
   - Already correctly configured for API-based approach
   - Contains proper OpenAI/Anthropic integration examples

3. **05-frontend-limitations.md** ✅
   - Already updated for API-specific constraints
   - Focuses on rate limiting, API keys, network latency instead of model storage

4. **06-implementation-roadmap.md**
   - Phase 2.1: Changed "Setup WebLLM or similar browser LLM" to "Setup API-based LLM connections (OpenAI/Anthropic)"
   - Added "Configure API key management" task
   - Updated success metrics: "Model load time < 30s" to "API response time < 5s"

5. **07-technical-decisions.md**
   - Updated rationale to emphasize "No local infrastructure required" instead of focusing on download savings
   - Already had correct API-based implementation examples

6. **README.md**
   - Changed "LLM: WebLLM with Llama 3" to "LLM: OpenAI/Anthropic APIs via LangChain"
   - Updated description from "browser integration" to "API integration"

### Key Architecture Points Now Clarified:

- **No model downloads**: Application loads instantly without 2-8GB model files
- **API-based**: All LLM operations via OpenAI/Anthropic endpoints
- **Client-side API keys**: Users provide their own API keys for security
- **Streaming responses**: Better UX through real-time token streaming
- **Rate limiting**: Proper handling of API provider limits
- **Cost tracking**: Monitor usage and API costs

### Implementation Priorities:

1. API key management and secure storage
2. Error handling for network/API issues  
3. Streaming response implementation
4. Rate limiting and retry logic
5. Cost optimization and usage tracking

All plans now consistently reflect the API-based approach without any references to local model execution or storage.

## Editor Architecture Simplification (2025-01-16)

Major change made to simplify the editor architecture by removing TipTap complexity and implementing a simple contentEditable solution.

### Changes Made:

1. **06-implementation-roadmap.md**
   - Updated Phase 3.5 from "Rich-Text Editor Integration" to "Simple Editor Implementation"
   - Marked Phase 3.5 as 100% complete
   - Updated overall progress from 75% to 80%
   - Removed TipTap-related tasks and replaced with contentEditable implementation

2. **07-technical-decisions.md**
   - Added new "Editor Architecture" section
   - Documented decision to use simple contentEditable over TipTap
   - Explained rationale and trade-offs

3. **Implementation completed**:
   - Removed TipTap dependencies and EditorToolbar component
   - Replaced with simple contentEditable div
   - Updated CSS from .ProseMirror to .content-editable selectors
   - Maintained AI edit button and patch functionality

### Key Benefits:

- **Simpler codebase**: Removed complex TipTap framework overhead
- **Better reliability**: No more toolbar selection conflicts
- **Faster development**: Direct HTML editing without framework constraints
- **Lighter bundle**: Removed 8 TipTap dependencies
- **MVP focus**: Prioritized core AI editing over rich formatting

### Trade-offs:

- No built-in formatting toolbar (can be added later if needed)
- Manual undo/redo implementation required
- Less sophisticated editing features

This change prioritizes the core AI patch editing functionality while maintaining a clean, maintainable codebase for the MVP.
